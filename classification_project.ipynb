    "We'll now summarize what we learned from analysis and modeling, make recommendations, discuss what to do next, and summarize our model.\n",
    "***\n",
    "- Exploration uncovered that some of the strongest drivers of churn include:\n",
    "    - Dependents\n",
    "    - Partners\n",
    "    - Automatic vs Manual Payments\n",
    "    - Monthly Charges\n",
    "    \n",
    "- All of this information suggest that our most reliable customers are price sensitive, people with families who greatly value the convenience of automatic payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendations to reduce churn:\n",
    "    - Lower monthly charges because our customers appear to be price sensitive\n",
    "    - Offer promotions that encourage clients to add partners and dependents to account. Once signed up, switching multiple people to a competitor becomes a barrier to exit and increases tenure.\n",
    "    - Invest in marketing that promotes the use of automatic payments because our clients will leave us for our competitors if they don't feel our services meet their convenience needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We created a model that identifies these variables and uses logistic regression to make predictions about churn.\n",
    "    - The model maintained an accuracy of roughly 74% on both in and out of sample data\n",
    "    - We expect it to perform with same accuracy on more unseen data in the future\n",
    "    - If our churn rate increases in the future, the model will become less accurate as it's recall metric is low so it tends to predict incorrectly when a customer churns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the near future I would like to use what we learned from this project to build a new, more refined model that will improve it's ability to predict when a customer is churning, when they actually are (ie. improved recall) as this is our current model's largest area of opportunity."
